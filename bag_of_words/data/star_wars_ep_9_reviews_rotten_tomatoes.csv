I appreciate JJ Abrams' attempt to make a coherent story out of Rian Johnson's sludge filled disaster but the convoluted and creatively bankrupt ending fails to achieve satisfaction.;1.5
Really Disney, all you can come up with is zombie palpatine?!! No wonder, TFA started strong, TLJ was the the start of the crash, TRoS is the wreckage.;0.5
In all my years watching the Star Wars franchise, I have never seen a movie quite like this. All of the action, and all of the suspense that has made this series a fan favorite has led to this moment. As the Skywalker saga comes to a close, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that there will be more incredible adventures in the near future. With that being said, STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER will hold a very special place in my heart as a story that will never be forgotten. If there's one thing that I've learned while watching this franchise, it's that there will always be a very special adventure that can only take place in a galaxy far, far away.;5.
sOmeHow paLpAtinE reTurNeD. It had fabulous features and a great finale but there were just some weird as characters and scenes.;3
Decent enough but a huge step down from the previous installment;3.
This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. Do you love Star Wars? If you do, do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie, it will ruin your perception of the franchise. Episode 6 was the perfect ending to the Skywalker saga, Anakin bringing true balance to the force in the perfect conclusion so there's no need to watch episodes 7, 8 and 9 and watch beloved characters drastically change their personalities off screen. Mark Hamill stated it best when he said that he felt he wasn't playing Luke he had to pretend it was a different character that he named Jake Skywalker. There's nothing that brings me more anger and rage than this movie, just thinking about it boils my blood, but if you like hearing a character yell REY repeatedly, "they fly now…yeah they fly now", seeing major liberties taken with the force to make you feel like you're in Hogwarts, and space horses then this movie is for you.;0.5
Takes an upper hand against episode 7 and 8. Even though the rise of Skywalker is disgraceful at the end when Rey says she is a Skywalker, the movie still has some good elements. Such as, pretty well storyline, using Lando in a correct way, good end fighting scene, the chemistry we've been waiting for with Rey and Ren, seeing Ren be more badass in the movie, etc. I didn't like how they had to rewrite C3POs memory when the dagger didn't even say anything that important…;2.5
This entire trilogy was an awful mess. I would sue if I owned stock in Disney for not representing the best interest of the shareholders.;0.5
Despite the incredible special effects, there was no way of distracting from the poor storytelling revolving around a contrived fetch quest, with glaring plot holes and terrible character arcs. How writers can take an absolute S Tier franchise with an already baked-in enthusiastic fandom of hundreds of millions and run it into the ground is beyond me.;2.5
I enjoyed this movie, it was a good conclusion to the sequel saga. It could have been done better but considering it followed up The Last Jedi it was significantly better. The effects were great, and the Sith troopers were awesome, but I don't really like the ending scene where she decides she is a Skywalker, that was weird. It had great effects and a decent story (considering the other movies in the saga). They did a good job of working with what they had.;4
